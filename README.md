# Leitlearn (Legacy)

> DEPRECATED: This repository holds the legacy version of the leitlearn.com project.

## Why this legacy release?
I built a new version of Leitlearn. To keep the project accessible to everyone and preserve its history, I decided to publicly release this legacy version.

## New version
The active, maintained version is available at [leitlearn.com](https://leitlearn.com).

This new version has been completely rewritten with a much more modern and robust stack:
- **Next.js** framework (App Router + Server Components)
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe, efficient and maintainable database interactions
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline with automated tests, linting, type-checking, and **automatic deployment to Vercel on every tag** (`vX.Y.Z` → instant production deploy via GitHub Actions + Vercel integration)
